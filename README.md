# MiSTer-scripts
Third party scripts for MiSTer FPGA

## Saturn core updater scripts
Small scripts that will update the Saturn core to the latest successful build from the workflow of [srg320's official Saturn repo on Github](https://github.com/srg320/Saturn_MiSTer).

- If you want to download the dual SDRAM version of the core get both scripts as the "saturn_ds-updater..." is calling the standard script for all the work.
- If you only want the single SDRAM version just get the "saturn-updater..." script.
